    "I’m an engineering manager, and a software developer, with a focus on the Web.",
    "I grew up in St. Johnʼs, Newfoundland & Labrador, a small city on the east coast of Canada. After finishing high school, I moved west to Calgary, Alberta, where I attended university. I briefly lived and worked in Edmonton, Alberta, before I moved to London, UK, where I remain.",
    "I’m passionate about good software, and the people who make it. I’m grateful that I get to work on one of my hobbies as a career - Iʼve been making websites for as long as I can remember. I enjoy sharing knowledge, almost as much as I enjoy gaining it. Curiosity is a driving value for me, and I think itʼs at the core of good building good software. I think itʼs important to empower developers, with patience and empathy, to make a product that scales, that can be iterated on efficiently, and that can improve the lives of all its users.",
    "Iʼm a person with low vision, and accessibility is at the core of everything I build. The Web is uniquely placed to empower those who face difficulties in their day to day life, and I believe that - when well considered - it can be a great, egalitarian force for good."
