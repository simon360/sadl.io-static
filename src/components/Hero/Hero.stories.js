          Whose woods these are I think I know. <br />
          His house is in the village though; <br />
          He will not see me stopping here <br />
          To watch his woods fill up with snow.{" "}

        <Paragraph>
          My little horse must think it queer <br />
          To stop without a farmhouse near <br />
          Between the woods and frozen lake <br />
          The darkest evening of the year.{" "}

        <Paragraph>
          He gives his harness bells a shake <br />
          To ask if there is some mistake. <br />
          The only other soundâ€™s the sweep <br />
          Of easy wind and downy flake.{" "}
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The woods are lovely, dark and deep, <br />
          But I have promises to keep, <br />
          And miles to go before I sleep, <br />
          And miles to go before I sleep.
